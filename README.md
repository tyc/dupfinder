dupfinder
=========

duplicate finder for files.

This python script will search through a specified directory for all the files and 
copy one instance of them into another directory. It leaves the original files and
directories untouched.

A new directory called Copied is created at working directory where these files
are copied into.

The problem it is trying to solve.
==================================

My wife and I take a lot of photos with our phones. When I transfer them onto our 
computer, there is no way of knowing whether I have already transferred the files 
to the computer or not. So to be safe, I copied all the files from the phone to
the computer, and clean up the files on the computer.

The reason for doing this
=========================

There are quite a few duplicate finders available, but as an exercise for me to learn
python, I have undertaken this project.
